        <p>My name is Melissa Kim Judd, the handsome dude next to me is my loving husband of 16 years. This past summer we took a trip to go see the Mayan ruins and dang it was hot. We live In Eagle Mountain UT and probably won't ever move. My husband is a software engineer. The job market is good in UT and, we have no desire to move to Seattle or California.</p>
        <p>I originally hail from the Land of Enchantment, I was born in Albuquerque New Mexico, and lived there until I met my husband and got married. I love being a mom, as someone who grew up not wanting kids, it is funny that they are my whole life and I wouldn't want it any other way. I am a proud introvert, sarcasm is my love language, I love watching anime, playing video games, and growing my garden (florals, vegetables, and fruit) I also love cooking and baking. I am currently trying to convince my husband that our family would benefit from owning a meat smoker.<p>
        <p>We are fortunate enough to have four children. Our oldest two attend high school at a charter school called UCAS. They will graduate High School with their Associate's degree.</p>
