           <p>Orange Pecan Cinnamon Rolls 

                Ingredients
                For the Dough
                3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
                1/4 cup granulated sugar 
                1/4 cup light brown sugar 
                1 tsp salt
                2 1/4 tsp instant 
                1 tsp cinnamon
                1 pinch nutmeg optional
                1 egg large, room temp
                1/2 cup milk
                1 tbsp vanilla extract 
                1/2 cup sour cream 
                6 tbsp unsalted butter 

                For the Filling
                4 tbsp butter room temp,
                3 tbsp granulated sugar
                2 tbsp light brown sugar
                1 tbsp cinnamon
                1 teaspoon orange zest
                1/2 cup of finly chopped pecans

                For the Glaze
                4 oz cream cheese room temp, 
                2 tbsp butter room temp, 
                1 tbsp vanilla extract 
                1 pinch salt
                1 tsp lemon juice 
                2 cups powdered sugar 
                1 tbsp milk plus more if needed for consistency
                Instructions
                For the Cinnamon Sugar:
                Mix cinnamon and the two sugars in a bowl then set aside.
                For the Rolls:
                In the bowl of your stand mixer add the flour, salt, spices, and sugars and 
                yeast then whisk together to combine and set aside.



                In a separate bowl add the milk, butter, vanilla, and sour cream. Microwave
                until warm to the touch (about 110F) and stir until butter is melted.
                Attach a dough hook to the mixer and pour the wet mixture into the dry then 
                run on low. Drop the egg in and mix until the dough comes together and it's
                tacky but doesn't stick to your fingers.
                Dump dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, 
                sprinkling with additional flour as needed then transfer to a large oiled 
                bowl. Cover and allow to rise in a warm place. This is a very enriched dough 
                so the yeast will take a bit of time to get going but the dough will more
                than double in size.



                On a well-floured surface roll the dough out to a rectangle thatâ€™s 1/4 an 
                inch thick. Spread the room temperature butter over the surface leaving a 
                little less than an inch at one of the narrow sides. If you choose the wider 
                side for the unbuttered strip then you'll end up with more cinnamon rolls, 
                but they will be smaller.
                Sprinkle generously with the cinnamon sugar then roll the side of the dough 
                across from the to create a spiral starting from the opposite ens of the
                unbuttered strip.



                Cut the dough into even pieces about an inch and a half long. You can use a
                length or dental floss that you loop around the roll then pull or just use 
                a sharp knife.
                Place the rolls cut side up in a baking dish and allow to rest in a warm
                place for about 40 minutes for a final rise. Make the glaze while the rolls 
                are rising or during the bake.



                Heat oven to 350F and Bake for about 28-30 minutes or until lightly browned 
                on top. If your rolls are getting a bit too brown at the 20 minute mark then
                cover loosely with foil and continue to bake.
                For the Glaze
                Place the cream cheese, butter, vanilla, salt, lemon juice and a tablespoon
                of milk in a bowl and beat until smooth. You can also make this VERY easily 
                in a small food processor if you have one. Once smooth add the powdered sugar 
                and beat once more until fully incorporated. You can mix in an additional
                tablespoon or two of milk if you prefer a thinner frosting. Drizzle about half 
                of the glaze over the cinnamon rolls RIGHT after you pull them from the oven 
                then add the remaining glaze once cooled or on individual pieces when serving.
